# Rep Count Data to JSON Converter

This small bash script is designed to convert workout data exported from the Rep Count app into JSON format. It parses the plain text workout logs and organizes the data into a structured JSON format for easy analysis and visualization.

## Folder Structure

The project follows a straightforward folder structure:

- **scripts:** This directory contains the main bash script used to convert the Rep Count data to JSON. You'll find the `workoutGenerateScript.sh` file here.

- **data:** This directory is intended for storing your input and output data files.
  - `workoutData.txt`: This is where you should place your plain text workout logs exported from the Rep Count app.
  - `output.json`: This is the output JSON file generated by the script.

- **tests:** This directory can be used for any unit tests you may want to create for your bash script. 

## How to Use

1. Ensure you have the necessary input data in the `data` directory (`workoutData.txt`).

2. Run the `workoutGenerateScript.sh` script from the `scripts` directory:

   ```bash
   ./workoutGenerateScript.sh
